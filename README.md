I'm a versatile developer with an undeniable passion for technology. With a solid professional experience of 3 years as a Visual Communication Manager and another 3 years as an Independent Designer, I've acquired fundamental skills to create and implement not only visual strategies but also product solutions.

Currently, I have been working as a Fullstack Developer for 1 year, where I was able to improve my technical skills and develop innovative solutions for personal and private projects with millions of users. I have a proactive profile and like to dive deep into understanding the product, from planning and design to development and implementation. This allows me to create complete and efficient solutions, considering all aspects involved, focusing on performance and accountability.

Furthermore, I am a learning enthusiast and a firm believer in the philosophy of learning by teaching. I feel great satisfaction in sharing my knowledge and experiences with other professionals, confident for collective growth. This approach also allows me to constantly improve my skills as I believe that learning is an ongoing and collaborative process.

If you are interested and want to know more, I have a profile on Instagram where I regularly talk about technology, and very soon I will also have a YouTube channel.
